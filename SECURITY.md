# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We will support the latest release and the last two versions before it. We do this in our spare time so if you want something quickly make more noise. :)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have any problems or suggestions just create an issue in the repo and we'll take a look.

Thanks!
