# Shared Code Library for Windows Presentation Foundation

A library of code shared for free use to help with common scenarios using WPF.

To use this, search NuGet for SharedCode.Windows.WPF

Since the [Community Toolkit](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CommunityToolkit.Mvvm/) now has good implementations for the commands we are removing them from this library.
