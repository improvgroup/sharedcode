# Shared Code Data Library

A library of code shared for free use to help with common data access scenarios.

To use this, search NuGet for SharedCode.Data.

The methods and helper classes in this library are centered around data access scenarios that do not specifically focus on any frameworks such as Entity Framework, Dapper, etc. Those libraries may have other projects added at a later time.
